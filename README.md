# AI-Interviewer-Prototype
This is a browser-based AI Interviewer prototype with multi-level assessment, real-time proctoring simulation, and voice-based AI interviews. Due to browser security limits, deep system checks are simulated, but the architecture is production-ready for backend and AI integration.
# 🤖 Real-Time AI Interviewer – Frontend Prototype

A modern **AI-powered interview platform prototype** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates how an automated interview system can conduct **technical assessments, proctoring, and AI-based interviews** in a browser environment.

> ⚠️ This is a **frontend-only showcase prototype** designed for demonstrations, HR presentations, college reviews, and MVP validation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Real-Time AI Interviewer** simulates a complete interview process:

1. **Multi-level technical quiz**
2. **Without Cheating (Proctoring) mode**
3. **AI Avatar-based interview round**
4. **Voice interaction using browser APIs**

The project focuses on **UI/UX, workflow, and system design**, while realistically simulating AI and proctoring behavior due to browser and security limitations.
